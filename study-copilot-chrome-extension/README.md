# Study Copilot Chrome Extension

## Project Description:
- Develop a Study Copilot Chrome extension using React with the following features:
  - A small image in the bottom right corner that opens a chat popup for text input/output powered by GPT-4o.
  - Ability for the user to start a Pomodoro session and specify what they want to study.
  - Ensure that the extension monitors the tabs the user visits during the Pomodoro session and makes sure they are related to the study target.
  - If the user visits an irrelevant website in a tab, the extension's chat popup should warn the user.

## Features:
- User-friendly interface with a visually appealing design.
- Integration with GPT-4o for advanced text input/output capabilities in the chat.
- Pomodoro timer functionality to help users focus on studying.
- Customizable study targets for each Pomodoro session.
- Real-time monitoring of the tabs the user visits to ensure relevance to the study target.
- Chat popup notifications to warn users when visiting irrelevant websites during a study session.

## Possible Enhancements and Improvements:
- Implement machine learning algorithms to predict relevant study topics based on user behavior.
- Include a feature to track user progress and provide feedback on study habits.
- Integration with popular productivity tools like Trello or Google Calendar for task management.
- Option to set study goals and receive motivational messages during study sessions.
- Ability to save study sessions and review them later for better learning outcomes.

## Programming Languages:
- React will be used for developing the Study Copilot Chrome extension due to its component-based architecture and efficiency in building interactive user interfaces.

## APIs:
- GPT-4o API will be integrated to power the text input/output chat functionality, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities for a seamless user experience.

## Packages and Libraries:
- React 17.0.2
- GPT-4o API Client Library
- Chrome Extension API

## Rationale for Technical Choices:
- React was chosen for its popularity, robust community support, and ease of building dynamic UI components.
- GPT-4o API was selected for its advanced language processing capabilities, enabling natural text interactions within the extension.
- Chrome Extension API is essential for seamless integration with the Chrome browser, allowing access to browser functionalities.

## Enhancements and Improvements Rationale:
- Implementing machine learning algorithms will enhance user experience by predicting relevant study topics based on behavior.
- Integration with productivity tools like Trello or Google Calendar will improve task management and organization.
- Saving study sessions for later review will aid in reinforcing learning and improving study habits.

By leveraging React, the GPT-4o API, and other necessary libraries, the Study Copilot Chrome extension will offer users a powerful study companion with advanced features for enhanced productivity and learning outcomes.
